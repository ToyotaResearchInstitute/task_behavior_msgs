# task_behavior_msgs #
[Behavior trees](https://github.com/ToyotaResearchInstitute/task_behavior_engine) provide the structure for execution of a finite set of tasks in a modular fashion.  This project provides the ROS introspection messages to report the status of the tree.

These messages are currently used by the [task_behavior_ros](https://github.com/ToyotaResearchInstitute/task_behavior_ros) package, which provides backend to set and access the messages. These messages are used for long term logging and will not be changed unless there is a very important reason.
